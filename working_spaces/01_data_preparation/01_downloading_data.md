# Downloading Data

Data can be downloaded for free from [cricsheet.org](https://cricsheet.org/matches/).

For this project, I am going to focus on One Day matches, both domestic and international.

The download for this project occured on 24/2/25, and so to replicate this project exactly all matches after this date should be disregarded. Readmes inside the relevant data subdirectories contain a list of all matches downloaded.
